### ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This report presents an analysis of the *Mall Customers* dataset with a focus on the **Spending Score (1-100)**. The goal is to identify behavioral insights and purchasing patterns using Apache PySpark in a distributed data environment.

The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Genre** (Male/Female)
- **Age** (Years)
- **Annual Income (k$)** (Integer)
- **Spending Score (1-100)** (Integer)

### ðŸ“Š Spending Score Distribution

An initial aggregation shows how customers are distributed across different spending scores.


| Spending Score | Count                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1â€“10           | High variance, some with high income             |
| 40â€“60          | Most customers fall in this range                |
| 80â€“100         | Smaller group, likely frequent or premium buyers |

This suggests a typical bell-shaped distribution with clusters on both extremes.

### ðŸ“ˆ Average Income by Spending Score

We grouped customers by their spending score and computed the average income:

| Spending Score | Avg Income | Count |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| 1              | 78.0       | 2     |
| 15             | 68.7       | 3     |
| 80             | ~87.5      | 3     |
| 97             | ~86.0      | 2     |

Key observations:
- **High income does not guarantee high spending score**, as some low-score groups had incomes above $70k.
- Customers in the **mid-score range (40â€“60)** are generally well distributed in income.
- Some **high-score customers** had both moderate and high income, indicating mixed segments.

### ðŸ§  Insights

- Spending Score is influenced by more than just income â€” possibly age, loyalty, or promotions.
- **Segmentation Opportunity**:
  - *High Score + Low Income*: Loyal budget-conscious buyers.
  - *High Score + High Income*: Premium targets for high-value products.
- The data can support **marketing strategies** for personalization and upselling.
